# Payments Exercise

## Objective

Add in the ability to create payments for a given loan using a JSON API call. You should store the payment date and amount. Expose the outstanding balance for a given loan in the JSON vended for `LoansController#show` and `LoansController#index`. The outstanding balance should be calculated as the `funded_amount` minus all of the payment amounts.

A payment should not be able to be created that exceeds the outstanding balance of a loan. You should return validation errors if a payment can not be created. Expose endpoints for seeing all payments for a given loan as well as seeing an individual payment.

## Implementation Notes

As requested, the repo was [duplicated](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) instead of forking so that it is not trackable from the original repo.
